# FinalProjectJM

Instructions: git clone the url https://github.com/JuanMoncada23/FinalProjectJM.git using your powershell or terminal. Once you've done that compile the file(s) by using javac *.java. After that to execute my program do java TicTacToe. From there you will be able to test my program. You can either play by yourself or with another person (more fun with 2 people). 

In verison 1 I have implemented the grid and ActionEvent and ActionListener. I have also implemented the 9 squares that I need for the game. And the first person to click on the square is X and the second person is O. When there is a winner or no one wins a message box appears asking the players whether they would like to play again. For version 2 I would like to get the buttons to work correctly when you click on yes or no. I would also like if possible add some color to the grid and prevent the players from changing where they select their X or O to go and if they try to to display an error message. The features I would of love to implement, but won't be able to is instead of using X's and O's it would of been sad cyclops face and smiley face. I also would of loved to add some sound to the game and be able to play against the computer. And have the game display out a message saying whose turn it is.
